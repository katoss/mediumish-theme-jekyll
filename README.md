# Best Practices for Online Peer-Production
This is a resource of best practices for the peer-production of knowledge, meant to serve as inspiration for people who want to build peer-production online platforms. 

This resource is developed as part of the [PhD of Katharina Kloppenborg](https://github.com/katoss/phd-project), as well as the [Open Life Science mentoring program](https://openlifesci.org/). 

It is currently a work in progress, so it might be worth to check it out every now and then in the following months :)

# Vision statement

“I am building a resource that collects best practices for the online peer-production of knowledge, so that people who want to develop these kinds of platforms can use it as a source of inspiration or add their own best practices. This resource is developed as part of my PhD, which is about building an online platform of this kind. Since peer-production has collaboration and sharing at its heart, I would like to expand this idea to the platform development process, and make it open and collaborative. In that way, my background research becomes something that other people with similar projects can profit from.”
